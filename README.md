# New-Dawn-Enactus-Project
### Project Manager: Punyaja Mishra

This project is initiated by Punyaa Mishra and is being worked under the Trent University Enactus Club to develop a platform for assisting the homeless population. The group has discovered an opportunity to revive the conditions of the homeless and take steps towards reviving their conditions.

## Project Definition

There were thousands of people identified as Homeless in the 2021 Canada Census. For the public to be able to go and help the homeless community, they need to be able to find the details about this population in a much easier way. 

The Project “New Dawn” aims to create a platform that will act as a census of the Homeless Population for the public to access and provide assistance. This platform will be a Web Application that will allow the general public to upload information about the homeless people with their details and the location to find them. This will give this community an identity and the general public who truly wishes to help will get a medium to find them and help them.
